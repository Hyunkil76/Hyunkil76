# Hello! I'm Hyunkil Hwang

### I'm an undergraduate student at [Seoul National University of Science and Technology](https://www.seoultech.ac.kr/index.jsp) and studying [Mechanical Automotive Engineering]() and [Electrical and Information Engineering](https://eie.seoultech.ac.kr/).
- I'm interested in Deep Learning, SLAM, Self-driving.
- I'm currently studying C++, probability, and robotics.


### Now I belong to the [MINT lab](https://mint-lab.github.io/) of Department of Computer Science.
- I'm currently making a equipment called [MINT-Cart](https://github.com/mint-lab/Mint_Cart) to get data.
- I'm researching a plane detection algorithm named ['Plane Fill'](https://github.com/mint-lab/Plane_Fill) to quickly detect planes.

### Now I'm making a mobile robot using Turtlebot3 packages without Dynamixel to help organize returned books as a graduate project.
- We're making two wheeled differential drive robot with DC encoder motors.
- we're using camera to specify where the book should be organized.
